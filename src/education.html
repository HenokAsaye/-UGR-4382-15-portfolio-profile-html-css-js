            <h4>Bachelor</h4>
            <p>
                I am currently a 3rd-year software engineering student at Addis Ababa University, where I'm building a strong foundation in computer science 
                and software development. My program has provided me with essential knowledge in areas like algorithms, data structures, software architecture,
                and various programming languages. I've also gained practical experience in web development, mobile applications, and systems design. Through my 
                studies, I'm developing important skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity, which are key to succeeding in the ever-changing 
                tech industry. With access to a supportive and collaborative environment, I'm building a network that will help me grow and prepare me for future
                opportunities, whether in the tech field or as an entrepreneur.

            <h4>Backend Course</h4>
            <p>
                The GDSC (Google Developer Student Clubs) Backend Course was an incredibly intensive three-month program that provided me with hands-on experience in backend development.
                Over the course of the program, I had the opportunity to work on a real-world project, which allowed me to apply the skills and knowledge I was gaining in a practical and
                impactful way. The course covered a wide range of backend technologies, including databases, APIs, authentication, and server-side frameworks, helping me develop a solid
                understanding of how to build and scale backend systems.
                Throughout the program, we were encouraged to collaborate with fellow participants, solve complex problems, and implement industry-standard practices, which made the experience
                both challenging and rewarding. By working on a real-world project, I not only deepened my technical abilities but also learned how to manage tasks, troubleshoot issues, and work
                in a team environment—skills essential for a successful career in software development. The GDSC Backend Course was a valuable learning experience that has equipped me with the tools
                and confidence to take on real-world backend challenges in the future.</p>
